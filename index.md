<div style="font-size: 0.8em; text-align: justify;">
I am an Assistant Professor at SOA University, Bhubaneswar. I hold a PhD in Computer Science and Engineering from NIT Silchar, India, where my research focused on multimodal machine translation (MMT). My research has centered on developing computational models to understand human language in complex and data-scarce environments.
